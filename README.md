List of DJ/producer/mc names that are puns of people's names, real or fictional.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Around the end of 2012, I noticed there was a trend of DJs with names that were a play of existing ones, such as RL Grime, Hudson Mohawke, Com Truise, and Diplo's *Trap Hawk Down*. A friend and I meant to make a list, or Wikipedia entry, but never it moved beyond our chats. Recently, I saw that DJ Harvey was coming to San Francisco, so that prompted me to finally materialise this list.

### Names I'm omitting:

  * bands like The Dandy Warhols because they're not known for making electronic music

  * folks with under 1000 followers on Soundcloud, or haven't been written up on RA. anyone can create some music and throw up a Soundcloud/Bandcamp profile, so I'd like to avoid that until they're better known
